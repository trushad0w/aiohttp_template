I’m not sure why but it won’t even let me do anything from this point in my account. I went online to your “help” page and followed the instructions for a frozen account... it ended up being a dead end. I then called customer support and they wouldn’t even tell me the issue with my account, just said it’s going to take 5-7 business days for an “account specialist” to look into my account. I don’t mind that, all I asked was if I could send that money back to the original sender or just cancel that payment. They said once a payment is sent through there’s no way to get it back to the sender, not even through customer support. So basically I have money sitting in my account and I can’t even touch it because my account is frozen? And they won’t allow me to speak with anyone before the seven business days. Absolutely shocked and mortified with this apps customer service skills. Very obvious that they don’t care about their customers experience and they have zero safeguards for protecting the financial aspect of this app. There should be some way to send that money back to the sender so I’m not sitting here waiting for nearly two weeks just to access those funds, or allow me to speak to an account specialist over the phone. Once this situation is handled I’m never using this app ever again.",

But are the exchanges on Venmo more than a mere convenience? I believe that the legitimacy and subsequent public trust of doing business through Venmo has benefited our society in the most positive way by providing a legitimate and convenient way to pay or be paid by anyone with a bank account and internet access. The widely accepted nature of the effect Venmo has had, increasing the ability for people to pay and receive debts and the perhaps unintended consequences have been that Venmo helps the economic conditions of the places it is used, putting money in people’s pockets in a fast convenient way and with Venmo, gone are many excuses for why a debt cannot be paid, which will be the greatest benefit to our economic life that Venmo has provided. This private sector venture is creating public sector benefits and for that I am grateful.",

For the first few days I had and used it I experienced no issues. Today it was a entirely different story. My card with adequate funds on it was declined everywhere causing much embarrassment. I finally reached out to Venmo and after several attempts got someone on the chat option. They basically told me they were being declined for security and could do nothing to assist me. Under normal circumstances I could understand and actually be thankful for a financial institution protecting my best interests but my card was declined at Kohl’s department store, two gas stations and even the ATM. The representative hand no remedy to give me beside cashing out to my bank and using my debit card. That would have been fine but the instant transfer wasn’t an option so 1 to 3 business days is now what I’ll have to wait to access the funds. Long story short if you want to send someone money who doesn’t mind waiting to get the actual money in the bank for a few days then Venmo is a fine option. If you want access to your funds quickly or the ability to use a debit card issue free use PayPal or your bank. Today’s issues put Venmo on the bottom of my list for fund transfer services for sure and the person I chatted with just solidified that I am making the correct choice.",

            "text": "I have had three venmo accounts and all of them had been shut down without any explanation. I use this app as a method of payment for my car cleaning services and without a doubt, each one gets shut down without hesitation in a matter of a couple of weeks, very frustrating. Venmo makes no effort to provide me with a reasonable explanation as to why ALL of my accounts have been shut down other than claiming it was their decision and I can no longer use their services.\n\nThe third time this happened, I decided to call their customer service number to see if they could give me a reason as to why my account had been first locked. I called the direct extension that claims to handle exactly that. Despite waiting on the phone for 15 minutes, I was given literally no answer besides that I have to wait for an email to come (the one where they don’t tell me anything) which would take 3-5 days. Why have a direct line that handles frozen accounts when they really don’t handle anything?\n\nWhat I ASSUME to be the reason for all of my accounts being shut down is that the name on my profile does not match the one on the card. Which for privacy reasons, I choose to only use the first letter of my last name, and when I made my other accounts and had to use my parent’s cards, of course the names would not be matching. Very frustrated and disappointed in both the customer service and the functionality of Venmo.",

            "text": "There are so many issues with Venmo it’s completely ridiculous. Their app is a complete joke. Every transaction I’ve ever done has had issues. Basically you get a generic error that says it’s your bank that’s the problem and that they are rejecting the payment. Which is completely untrue. That happens like 20 times and then randomly on that 21st time it goes through an hour or two later. The customer service is the worst I’ve ever seen. They deactivate accounts without giving a reason or even attempting to contact the account holder first. They just deactivate the account and say we are not going to give you a reason (claiming that this is to protect their other users because knowing why is somehow a security risk). They don’t even let you respond. “If you have any questions on this decision, this matter is closed and we can’t help you”. All the funds in the account they put under hold and you will likely never see them again. They are basically a bunch of thieves taking money from good people who made valid transactions that they deem invalid for their own made up reasons that they don’t want to share. When they see an opportunity, they cash in. I could keep going on with their bad business practices but my advice to anyone is just stay away. I personally wish I had never used their service, if you can use something else. Unless of course you like throwing your money in the trash or burning it.",
